#question would you consider prompt engineeering direct manipulation?
#### interaction style
- input?
- output presented?
- internal objects?
### cli:
very linear? commands are imposed by the systems

> _gpts are new types of cli's ?_

CHI has #papers on direct manipulation on chatgpt?

### Menus and forms
discover the languge as you go `syntaxless`
this (forms) came to be as a lot of websites were just large databases
- it's not fluid
- you have to know everyhting before you start fillign the form
still imposed by the system
very repetitive

poorly designed becasue designed for computer and not humans
(example sncf and maps and city mapper)
refining my choice

### navigation
input is selecting a link

same anchor could have diffrerent information (semantically)

dis:
where am i??
_lost in hyperspace_

#question is navigational linking offline like research papers, serendipidy

#quesiton is transcluison similar to things like blogs, notion, obsidian

#### direct manipulation (GUI) (wysiwyg)
impression that the user is in control
- because the system reacts even if it doesn process the object of interest
- no automation
- any automation a non fluid extension
- built on people's real life skills
- the back button that older people dont know about
##### Principles of DM 
1. continiuos representation
2. phyicsal actions rather than complex syntax
3. quick, incremental, reversible
4. layered approach to faciliate learnig
#question can we include advantages of other interaction styles to DM?
- liek programming langugaes dont have direct result
- disconnect between programmers and hci
- always running for backwords learning #ideas 


automator

eup
incrementally
- or other abstract feilds

##### WIMP
windows icons (representaion)
menu (interacts)
pointers (input)

wimp interfaces can result in navigation linking of complex xommands, resulting in indirect manipulation
- Canva?

#### gesture input
types of gestures
- point
- semaphoric
- iconic
- manipulation

hard to _discover_

segmenting the gestures between the system and other wise

### recog vs recall
recog: the system provides the information, you recognize what you are looking for

### multimodal styles
#papers put that there
interpretation based interfaces are difficult and makes mistakes

### vr interaction style
kinesthetic feedback

#### MR/augmented reality
#papers A-book wendy mackay
inform 3d obect interactions (MIT 2013)
social interaction issiue with googel glass

zooids:  inria 2017

Future?
BCI
emotional agents
robots
