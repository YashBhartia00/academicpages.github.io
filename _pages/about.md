I am an Computer Science graduate from [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), currently pursuing masters in computer science: Interaction Graphic and design at Institute Polytechnique Paris. I like Vampires, linguistics and Board games. In other times I make games, found on [my itch.io](https://dicefinity.itch.io/) and work as tech lead at my game studio: [Inkenbloodstudios](https://inkenbloodstudios.carrd.co).

I have been directing games for 4 years, a showcase of projects published under my mentorship can be found [here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUXuZHnLv4D/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheetdevsoc.itch.io) and can be played [here](https://devsoc.itch.io)

A collection of my [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6BePDDYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [projects](/projects/) can be viewed on this site along with my [CV](/files/CV_Yash Bhartia.pdf).
