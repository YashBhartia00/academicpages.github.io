I am an undergraduate student from [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), actively looking for Developer roles. I am passionate about game design and Language processing (NLP).

I am also the Game Development head of [Developer's Society](https://devsoc.club/) leading a team of more than 40 people. My published games can be found [here](https://dicefinity.itch.io/) and a showcase of projects published under my mentorship can be found [here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUXuZHnLv4D/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheetdevsoc.itch.io)

A collection of my [research](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) can be viewed on this site along with my [CV](/files/CV_Yash Bhartia.pdf).
